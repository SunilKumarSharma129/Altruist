          Allahabad Fort is a fort built by the Mughal emperor Akbar at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India in 1583. The fort stands on the banks of the Yamuna near its confluence with the river Ganges. It is recognised by the Archaeological Survey of India as a monument of national importance.
          The Allahabad Fort was constructed by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1583.
          Akbar named the fort Illahabas ("blessed by Allah"), which later became "Allahabad".
          The fort was first garrisoned by British East India Company troops in 1765 as part of the Treaty of Allahabad, signed after the Battle of Buxar by Commander-in-Chief of British India Robert Clive, Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, and the ruler of Awadh, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula.

     <p>
      One of the holiest places in Central India, Triveni Sangam is located about 7 kilometres away from Civil Lines in Allahabad (Prayagraj). It is the meeting point of three rivers - Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati (which is a mythical river, supposed to have dried up more than 4,000 years ago). It is one of the places where the Kumbh Mela is held once every 12 years. The exact date of the Mela is determined according to the Hindu calendar i.e. the Panchanga.

      All three rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati are highly revered rivers in Indian mythology, and hence the confluence point of these rivers hold tremendous religious importance. According to Hindu mythology, taking a bath in the holy Triveni Sangam is supposed to flush away all the sins and free you from the cycle of rebirth. Moreover, the Sangam itself is a beautiful and peaceful place to visit. The brownish Ganga meeting the slightly greenish Yamuna is indeed a sight to behold.
      
      If you take a boat ride to the gently flowing waters of Ganga and Yamuna, you'll be able to make out the difference in colours of water from the two rivers. There are also makeshift wooden banks made at the Sangam. Hence, devotees who want can take a bath right at the confluence point. The water is clean enough at the Triveni Sangam for a bath, especially during the winters; and also not very deep, so it is fun to take a dip in the water here.

      Anand Bhawan is the former residence of Nehru family which has now been transformed into a museum showcasing various artefacts and articles of the era of Independence movement in India. The double-storey mansion was personally designed by Motilal Nehru.

      When the prior residence of Nehru's family Swaraj Bhavan started to be used as an office of Indian National Congress, a new Nehru residence was designed by Motilal Nehru, a notable independence movement leader, and politician. The house is beautifully adorned with the wooden furniture imported from China and Europe and various artefacts from all around the world. 
      
      Anand Bhawan has an important historic value not only because of its construction but also for the major role that it has played in the history of India. It was visited by many famous freedom fighters to develop the conspiracies to drive Britishers out of the country. In 1970, Anand Bhavan was donated to the Indian government by Indira Gandhi, to convert it into a mational museum to keep intact the legacy of Nehru family.

      Lying at Lukarganj, Khusro Bagh is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Allahabad. The walled bracketing of the Khusro Bagh is a stunning remnant of the Mughal architecture.

      It houses three sandstone tombs of the Jehangir family; his wife; Shah Begum, his oldest son; Khusrau Mirza and his daughter; Sultan Nithar Begum. Most of the design of the place is credited to Aqa Reza, an artist on Jehangir's court. Landscaped amid an elaborately beautiful garden of guava trees and roses, the Bagh cites intricate carvings and inscriptions on each of the mausoleums.

      The University of Allahabad is a collegiate central university located in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was established on 23 September 1887 by an Act of Parliament and is recognised as an Institute of Eminence (IoE) . It is one of the oldest modern universities in India.[2] Its origins lie in the Muir Central College, named after Lt. Governor of North-Western Provinces, Sir William Muir in 1876, who suggested the idea of a Central University at Allahabad, which later evolved to the present university.[3][4] At one point, it was known as the "Oxford of the East".[5] Its Central University status was re-established through the University of Allahabad Act 2005 by the Parliament of India.
      The foundation stone of the Muir Central College was laid by Governor-General of India, Lord Northbrook on 9 December 1873. The college was named after Sir William Muir, Lt. Governor of United Province, who was the key person in its foundation.
